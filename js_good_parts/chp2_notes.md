## Chapter 2: Grammar

#### Comments
The /* */ form of block comments came from a language called PL/I. PL/I chose those strange pairs as the symbols for comments because they were unlikely to occur in that languageâ€™s programs, except perhaps in string literals. In JavaScript, those pairs can also occur in regular expression literals, so block comments are not safe for commenting out blocks of code. For example:
```javascript
/*
    var rm_a = /a*/.match(s);
*/
```
causes a syntax error. So, it is recommended that /* */ comments be avoided and //
comments be used instead. In this book, // will be used exclusively.

#### Numbers
JavaScript has a single number type. Internally, it is represented as 64-bit floating point, the same as Java's double. There is no separate integer type, so 1 and 1.0 are the same value.

#### Strings
A string literal can be wrapped in single quotes or double quotes. It can contain zero or more characters. The \ (backslash) is the escape character. JavaScript was built at a time when Unicode was a 16-bit character set, so all characters in JavaScript are 16 bits wide.

JavaScript does not have a character type. To represent a character, make a string with just one character in it.

The escape sequences allow for inserting characters into strings that are not normally permitted, such as backslashes, quotes, and control characters. the `\u` convention allows for specifying character code points numerically.
```javascript
"A" === "\u0041"
```

Strings are immutable. Once it is made, a string can never be changed. But you can make a new string by concatenating other strings together with the + operator.
```javascript
'c' + 'a' + 't' === 'cat'
```

#### False Values
* false
* null
* undefined
* The empty string ``
* THe number 0
* THe number NaN

All other values are truthy, including trude, the string 'false', and all objects.

#### Disruptive Statements
The *return* statement causes the early return from a function. It can also specify the value to be returned. If a return expression is not specified, then the return value will be undefined.

The *break* statement causes the exit from a loop statement or a switch statement. It can optionally have a label that will cause an exit from the labeled statement.
